# Fair Weather Hikers (full)
... is the full version of the fairweatherhikers (cli) application. Fair Weather Hikers is a MEAN stack app for planning hikes using an interactive map, trail info, and weather data. It has the ability to save trail data on a user's secure profile.

## Create a secure user profile (or not)!
Signing up is easy and secure! Just enter an  email and the password you
would like to use and that's it!  If that email is already in use, you'll
need to use another one (or use the default view). The default view allows you to use the site without access to bonus features like saving your favorite trails (and your normal starting location, in our next release).

## Sign in!
Signing in is easy too! It works exactly how you'd think it would!  Enter your email
and password -- if it matches what's in the database, you'll be logged in and whisked away to the main page where you'll see all of the amazing trails!

## Create a customized profile!
Just select the profile button and you'll be able to create a list of your favorite trails! Select all the trails you'd like from the full list, and when you're ready, hit the button! The new trails will be added to your collection! It's that easy! Instead of having your map view cluttered with all 3000 trails in the database, your view just includes your favorites.

## Trail Model
The model used for creating each trail includes:

* Trail Name
* Latitude
* Longitude
* Difficulty
* Trail length
* Average time to complete hike
